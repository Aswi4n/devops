DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops). It aims to shorten the development lifecycle, enhance collaboration, and improve software quality through automation, continuous integration, continuous delivery (CI/CD), and monitoring. DevOps fosters faster and more reliable software development and deployment.
